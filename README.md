# tvsorter
Sorts TV episodes from Soaper-dl format ``(SEASON.EPISODE)`` into Media server useable files.

## INSTRUCTIONS;
Put tvsorter.sh in /usr/local/bin, chmod u+x tvsorter.sh then go to your path where your desired season is stored e.g.
<br>``/media/TV/The Boys (2019)/``
<br>Episodes should be formatted as ``(SEASON.EPISODE)`` for example, Season 3 Episode 5 of The Boys should be ``3.5.mp4`` in path ``/media/TV/The Boys (2019)/Season 03``.
<br>**VERY IMPORTANT NOTE!**
<br>The file path HAS to be ``whereyoustore/shit/{TV SHOW NAME (YEAR IT CAME OUT)}/Season 0{SEASON NUMBER}`` There is no negotiating unless you rewrite the code, maybe could rewrite it to allow other sorts of types but that's an issue for another day.
